This project is a comprehensive inventory management system developed for a tire shop. The system allows for the efficient tracking and management of tire stock, customer orders, and service scheduling. The goal of this application is to streamline operations, improve inventory accuracy, and enhance decision-making for the business.

Key Features:
Inventory Management: Real-time updates of tire stock levels, including tire types, sizes, and quantities.
Customer Orders: Track and manage customer orders, including order status, delivery dates, and associated customer information.
Service Scheduling: Schedule and manage tire installation, maintenance, and other services, ensuring smooth service flow.
Reporting: Generate reports on tire inventory levels, sales, and customer orders to assist in business decision-making.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for both staff and customers, with an emphasis on user experience.



Technologies Used:
Frontend: React (for building the user interface)
Backend: Node.js and Express (for server-side operations)
Database: MongoDB (for storing tire inventory, orders, and service data)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) (for secure user login and session management)
Deployment: Heroku (for live deployment)



This system is designed to optimize the workflow of tire shops, ensuring that both inventory and service scheduling are efficient and well-managed.



Future Improvements:
Integration with a payment gateway to allow for online payments.
Advanced search functionality for tire models, brands, and sizes.
Real-time stock alerts when inventory is low.
